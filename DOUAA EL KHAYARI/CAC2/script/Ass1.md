This dataset examines student achievement in secondary education from two Portuguese schools. It includes a variety of attributes related to student grades, demographics, social background, and school-related factors. The data were collected from official school reports and student questionnaires.

Two separate datasets are provided, each corresponding to a different subject: Mathematics (mat) and Portuguese language (por).

According to Cortez and Silva (2008), both datasets were used for binary and five-level classification, as well as regression tasks.

It is important to note that the target variable G3 (final grade) is strongly correlated with G1 and G2, which represent the grades from the first and second periods, respectively. This correlation exists because G3 reflects the final outcome of the academic year. While predicting G3 without G1 and G2 is more challenging, such predictions are considered more valuable for practical applications (see the referenced paper for further details).
