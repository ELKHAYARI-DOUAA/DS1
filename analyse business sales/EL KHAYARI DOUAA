Description:
This dataset provides a structured, multi-feature representation of business sales activity across diverse product lines. Each record contains attributes such as Product ID, Product Category, Brand, Seasonal Flags, Promotion Indicators, Product Placement, and Sales Volume.
The data is standardized and suitable for both supervised and unsupervised machine-learning workflows.

Analytical Value & Use Cases:
Feature Engineering:
Enables creation of derived variables including promotional effectiveness metrics, seasonal impact scores, categorical embeddings, and brand-level aggregation features.

Predictive Modeling:
Supports advanced ML pipelines such as Gradient Boosting (XG Boost, Light GBM, Cat Boost), Random Forest, Linear/Elastic Net regression, and deep-learning approaches for regression or sales-forecasting tasks.

Pattern Discovery:
Allows clustering, segmentation, and association-rule mining to reveal product-demand patterns and category-level sales behavior.

Business Intelligence:
Useful for generating dashboards, KPI tracking, A/B testing of promotions, and evaluating product assortment strategies.

Data Quality & Structure:
Clean tabular format optimized for EDA, modeling, and visualization.
2.Suitable for cross-validation experiments, hyperparameter optimization, and model interpretability techniques like SHAP and feature importance.
